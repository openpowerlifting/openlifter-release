      <description>The OpenLifter project was started in November 2018 by the OpenPowerlifting team in order to advance the state of the art in competition software.  OpenLifter is designed to...  be the world&#39;s first free and open-source meet software; have a simple, obvious interface and not require much training; be completely crash-proof by using a single global state; work with one projector and one cheap computer running any OS; make the projected display audience-readable.</description>
