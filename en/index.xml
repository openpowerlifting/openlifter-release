      <description>FAQ  Does OpenLifter support pounds? Yep.
  Can one lifter be in multiple divisions or events? Yes. On the Registration page, the Division and Event fields can take multiple values for one lifter. The first Division that&#39;s entered will be the one shown on the Lifting screen table.
  Can I have multiple platforms? Yes. You&#39;ll need some way to transfer files between computers, usually with a USB key.</description>
